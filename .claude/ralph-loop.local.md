Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Find the first unchecked task (- [ ]). Implement it fully. Mark it complete by changing - [ ] to - [x] in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. Commit the changes with a message matching the task name. Then run the verification check for that phase if all tasks in the phase are now complete. If you need a credential, environment variable, or external service value that is not in .env or inferable from context, stop and list exactly what is needed. Otherwise continue immediately to the next unchecked task. When every task in every phase is checked off, output <promise>IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE</promise>
